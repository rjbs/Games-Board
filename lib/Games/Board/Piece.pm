=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Games::Board;

  my $board = Games::Board->new;

  $board->add_space(
    id   => 'go',
    dir  => { next => 'mediterranean', prev => 'boardwalk' },
    cost => undef
  );

  my $tophat = Games::Board::Piece->new(id => 'tophat')->move(to => 'go');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a base class for representing the pieces in a board game.  

=cut

=method new

This method constructs a new game piece and returns it.

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, %args) = @_;

  return unless $args{id};
  return unless eval { $args{board}->isa('Games::Board') };

  my $piece = { %args };

  bless $piece => $class;
}

=method id

This returns the piece's id.

=cut

sub id {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->{id};
}

=method board

This returns the board object to which the piece is related.

=cut

sub board {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->{board};
}

=method current_space_id

This returns the id of the space on which the piece currently rests, if any.
It it's not on any space, it returns undef.

=cut

sub current_space_id {
  my $piece = shift;
  $piece->{current_space};
}

=method current_space

This returns the Space on which the piece currently rests, if any.  It it's not
on any space, it returns undef.

=cut

sub current_space {
  my $piece = shift;
  return unless $piece->{current_space};
  $piece->board->space($piece->{current_space});
}

=method move

  $piece->move(dir => 'up')

  $piece->move(to  => $space)

This method moves the piece to a new space on the board.  If the method call is
in the first form, the piece is moved to the space in the given direction from
the piece's current space.  If the method call is in the second form, and
C<$space> is a Games::Board::Space object, the piece is moved to that space.

=cut

sub move {
  my $piece = shift;
  my ($how, $which) = @_;
  my $new_space;
  my $old_space = $piece->current_space;

  if ($how eq 'dir') {
    return unless $old_space;
    return unless $new_space = $old_space->dir($which);
  } elsif ($how eq 'to') {
    return unless eval { $which->isa('Games::Board::Space') };
    $new_space = $which;
  } else {
    return;
  }

  return unless !$old_space || $old_space->take($piece);
  $new_space->receive($piece);
}
